# Survey-of-Consumer-Finances
Project using the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) dataset

Introduction
Project ObjectiveÂ¶
The objective of this project is to analyze and segment households from the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) that have either been turned down for credit or have a fear of being denied credit. By utilizing clustering techniques, we aim to group these households into distinct clusters and examine the differences between them. This will help in understanding their financial behaviors and concerns more deeply.

Dataset
This project uses the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) dataset. The specific columns of interest for this analysis include:

turnfear: Indicates whether a household has been turned down for credit or fears being denied credit.
debt: Represents the Total value of debt held by household, 2019 dollars
educ: Refers to the education level of the household's primary respondent.
houses: Total value of primary residence of household, 2019 dollars
inccat: Categorizes the Income percentile groups.
asset: Total value of assets held by household, 2019 dollars
These features will be used to segment the households and explore the differences between clusters.

Relevance
Understanding the characteristics of households that are turned down for credit or fear credit denial is crucial for improving financial services and policies. By clustering these households based on their debt, education, housing, and income categories, this project aims to reveal distinct patterns and insights. This can help financial institutions design more tailored and effective credit products and support services, and assist policymakers in addressing issues related to credit access and financial inclusion.
