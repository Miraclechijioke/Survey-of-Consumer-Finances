Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and segment households from the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) 
that have either been turned down for credit or have a fear of being denied credit. 
By utilizing clustering techniques, we aim to group these households into distinct clusters and examine the differences between them. 
This will help in understanding their financial behaviors and concerns more deeply...
